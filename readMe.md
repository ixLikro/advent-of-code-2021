### Advent of Code 2021

My solutions for the awesome [Advent of code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/) in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/).

To run a day go into that subdirectory and run the Elixir-Script.
```
cd day09
elixir Day9.exs
```

Usually the script prints just 2 lines which represents the solution of the first and the second puzzle part.
